\title{Plot Differential Abundance Results}
\usage{
plot_da(maaslin_res, groups, cols = NULL, pthresh = 0.25)
}
\arguments{
\item{maaslin_res}{A data frame containing MaAsLin2 results, typically from
\code{Maaslin2::Maaslin2()}. Must contain columns \code{feature}, \code{coef}, and \code{qval}.}

\item{groups}{A character vector of length 2 specifying the group names being
compared. The first element is the reference group (negative coefficients),
and the second is the comparison group (positive coefficients).}

\item{cols}{A vector of colors for the two groups. Default is \code{NULL}, which
uses the NPG color palette from ggsci.}

\item{pthresh}{A numeric value specifying the q-value (FDR-adjusted p-value)
threshold for significance. Default is \code{0.25} (MaAsLin2 default).}
}
\value{
A ggplot object showing differentially abundant species as a horizontal
dot plot, with coefficient values on the x-axis and species names on the y-axis.
Points are colored by enrichment direction.
}
\description{
This function creates a dot plot visualizing differentially abundant taxa from
MaAsLin2 results. Points are colored by the group in which each taxon is enriched,
with the coefficient value indicating the direction and magnitude of the effect.
}
\examples{
# Example usage with MaAsLin2 results:
# da_plot <- plot_da(maaslin_results, groups = c("Control", "Treatment"))
# da_plot <- plot_da(maaslin_results, groups = c("Healthy", "Disease"),
#                    cols = c("blue", "red"), pthresh = 0.1)
